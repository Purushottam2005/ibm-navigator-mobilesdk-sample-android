# Sample Application for IBM Content Navigator SDK (Java) for Android

Sample Application to demonstrate the features of IBM Content Navigator SDK (Java) for Android

**This Sample app will not compile without the IBM Content Navigator SDK jar and its dependency jar files. You can obtain the latest jar files from this link: ** 

## Usage

Create a "libs" folder under "SampleApp" directory and simply place IBMECMCore.jar and its dependency jars into that folder. The sample app's gradle file already has a reference to the SDK jars. Additionally, you can connect only to IBM Content Navigator 2.0.3 fixpack 5 backend environments (more information [here](http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/content-navigator))
